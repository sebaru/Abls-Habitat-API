# Abls-Habitat Project

Abls-Habitat is my own project to do home automation. it presents:

* one or more [Agents](https://github.com/sebaru/abls-habitat-agent), in house, to interact with sensors and outputs
* one [API](https://github.com/sebaru/abls-habitat-api) on SaaS, main process of project, to handle all of agents
* one [Console](https://github.com/sebaru/abls-habitat-console) to configure each element and develop [D.L.S module](https://docs.abls-habitat.fr/)
* one [Home](https://github/com/sebaru/abls-habitat-home) frontend for all users

This software is Work In Progress. It is a complete refund of all-in-one Watchdog Project.
I'm developing on my sparse-time, not so easy with little kid :-).

All detailed documentations [are here](https://docs.abls-habitat.fr)
Have a good day, Sebaru.

# What is Abls-Habitat API

This is the main API for working with [Abls-Habitat Console](https://github.com/sebaru/abls-habitat-console), [Abls-Habitat HOME](https://github.com/sebaru/abls-habitat-Home),
and [Abls-Habitat Agent](https://github.com/sebaru/abls-habitat-agent).

Main Goal is to separate things in my legacy Watchdog project and be able to simplify each components.

Maybe one of you may help if interested.

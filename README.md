# Abls-Habitat API

**Abls-Habitat API** is part of [Abls-Habitat Project](https://docs.abls-habitat.fr).
This software is **Work In Progress**.
It is a complete refund of built-in API from [Watchdog Project](https://github.com/sebaru/Watchdog)

It will be main API for working with [Abls-Habitat Console](https://github.com/sebaru/ABLS-Console), [Abls-Habitat IHM](https://github.com/sebaru/ABLS-Home),
and [Abls-Habitat Agent](https://github.com/sebaru/ABLS-Agent).

Main Goal is to separate things in my project and be able to simplify each components.

Maybe one of you may help if interested.

I'm developing on my sparse-time, not so easy with little kid :-).

Have a good day,
Sebaru.
